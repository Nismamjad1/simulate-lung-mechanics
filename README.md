# Lung Model Simulation Project 

## Problem Statement

The Lung Model Simulation project aims to create a lung model that emulates real lung functions and assesses its stability. The methodology involves developing open-loop and closed-loop configurations of a lung model using transfer functions representing alveolar pressure as air flows. The project explores how a PID controller can enhance system stability and examines how arbitrary responses impact the step response of the model.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project include:

1. Designing a lung model capable of generating graphs and signals mimicking human lung functions.
2. Developing a prototype to enhance existing respiratory ventilation methods.
3. Addressing potential errors (steady-state error) by implementing a PID controller to reduce error and stabilize the system.
4. Establishing control systems for initial parameters to measure changes in pressure and volume through airflow resistance measurements.
5. Incorporating feedback and adaptation of lung mechanics in the system calculations.

## Results

The analysis of the results reveals the following:

1. Both open-loop and closed-loop systems are stable when a PID controller is employed, significantly enhancing stability and eliminating errors.
2. The application of arbitrary input signals, such as square waves, demonstrates that the overall response of the system is improved in the closed-loop configuration.

## Usage

To replicate and explore the lung model simulation project, follow these steps:

1. **Data Input**: Gather relevant data and measurements related to lung mechanics and ventilation.
2. **Code Execution**: Execute the provided code to simulate the lung model based on the described methodology. Ensure you have the necessary software and libraries installed.
3. **Data Analysis**: Analyze the simulation results to assess the stability and performance of the open-loop and closed-loop systems with PID control.
4. **Visualization**: Visualize the results through graphs and signals to understand how the lung model emulates real lung functions.
